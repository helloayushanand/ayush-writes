it rips my soul into two halves
one for you
one for me,
as i collect mine
and you collect yours
of mine
we separate
till infinity.
yes this tune
raging in my ears
have some beat to share
with you
have some tears to shed
for you
but they will remain
there
and let the silence
decorate
our heart beats.
together.

yes i am drowning
in the spiral
of the pool
which was created
to drown fishes
so i was thrown
to sip the water
from your shores
and let my nose
become gills
so that you survive
in me.
you flourish in me.
in my soul.
in my heart.
and then when i reached
the very center
of the spiral
i was crushed
like a bottle of wine.
you were crushed.
but you were the wine.
so you got spilled all over
me
and the spiral itself.
my soul was spilled that day.

i carry my half
alone
daily
waiting for something
under this night sky.
and then it rings
it rings in my head that
this is it.
this is where it ends.
alone.
frightened.
lost.
under the night sky.
sharing the darkness.
sparing the lights
and just feeding on silence.
waiting for the other half.
which is mine
but yours.
and then i sleep
i sleep like never before.
i carry the images of you
in my dreams
floating in front of eyes
soothing the chills
and frills of the mountains
and giving me the faintests
of smiles.
i float with you
i dance with you
on the tunes
which i had heard and saved
with me
only for you to listen.
and you listen.
you listen like it is the last song
you will listen.
and then
you sleep.
i sleep.
we sleep.

i just never wake up.

Ayush
