Here I sit,
Looking at her
And smiling
With my widest grin possible.
Here I sit,
Blushing at her
And letting myself
Get soaked inside that ocean.
Because she is that wave
Which never quits
Hitting the shore
Again and again.
Because she is that
Dawn and dusk
Where you can see both
The sun and the moon
Talking to each other.
She is that scar
That moon is wearing on its face
Which enlightens its beauty.
She is that magical fragrance
Of the soil which
You feel after the rain.
She is that horizon
Where even the
Sky and the earth meets.
She is that book
Whose each and every word
Depicts poetry.
And guess what?
She is the owner
Of that smile
Which can even surpass
The beauty of the
Twinkling stars of the heaven.
And that is why,
Here I sit,
Feeling blessed
To witness all these
At the same moment
And perhaps it is where
Eternity lies!

Ayush
