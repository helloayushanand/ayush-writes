I don't want to write a sad poem now.
There will be no sorrows.
No death.
Nothing.

So I pack my pen and paper.
Get up from my office chair.
Leave the ac hall.
And just start wandering
On the busiest streets of Bangalore.

The trees are pink.
Sorry, they were pink.
Now they are shedding their
pink flowers.
All around the footpaths.
On which an old homeless couple sleeps.

I watch them everyday while going to the office.
Today the man is singing
In a language which is foreign to my ears.
I want to sit there and listen
I want to have conversations with them,
I want to hear their stories.
But all i can see or get are their smiles.
Blossoming more than the fallen pink flowers.

I wonder who is adorning whom?

I move ahead butchering the flowers
Under my feet.

I watch people watch ipl
While driving a car.
Or an auto,
Or even a bike.
I watch them stop at red light
And continue watching the game.
I watch two people inside the same car
Watching same match
On two different phones.

And slowly i realise that how
Sometimes this city becomes too big
To just talk.

But then
I stop at a tea stall.
I order a tea,
I sit down.
I try to understand the people around me.
I can't comprehend what they speak.
Because of the language barrier.
But i watch their hands.
Their lips.
The tone of the voices.
The highs and lows.
I watch them laugh
While smoking a cigarette
While having a sip.
I try to read their eyes
Without directly looking into them.
I am getting better at this slowly and steadily.
I hope one day i learn the language too.

Then i get up,
Pay the shopkeeper.
Throw the cup in dustbin
And start walking back.
I see the couple sleeping now.
Peacefully.
They have a mosquito net
Which somebody must have given to them.
I wonder where they drink water from,
What they eat,
Where they go toilet to.

There is silence.
Which i can hear now.
There are no songs.
The road is still.
The vehicles have stopped at the signal.
The tea shop is quite.
The match is over.
But,
The flowers are still falling
On the streets,
On the footpath,
On their mosquito net.

I pick one of the fallen flowers.
Keep it in my shirt pocket this time.
And continue my journey
Back to the desk.
Where i will be writing codes,
Algorithms,
And poems
Which will be sad,
Painful,
And too much to deal with.

Ayush
