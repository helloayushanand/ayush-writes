Anxiety slipped into my room today
through the peep hole which i had made for the lizards to come in.
I like lizards,
they give me company when i am alone weeping and counting my veins,
or when i am talking to someone,
or even when i am not in the room.
they just stay on the walls, eat bugs,
and patiently wait for me to come back like an indoor plant.

i don't like anxiety though.
but she was there,
i saw her crawling the walls,
scared of me,
shivering.
she finally reached the floor.
she sat there silently, hugging her knees
with all her arms and shoulders and fingers and palms.
she watched me watching her watching me.
we both felt at home.

we talked that night about my cactus plant,
about her broken teeth
about how we need to plant more trees
about how friendship sucks,
and how brutal money is.
we talked about sweat, t shirts, bamboo, water, leaves, walls, watches, colours and frisbees.

we talked about how watermelons are more red these days,
how balloons are beautiful,
how water is scarce
and how rare sparrows have become.
we discussed in length about the death of my plants
and my failed attempt of saving them.
we discussed how they tried living till their last but nature is cruel.
we discussed where i had buried them back in the home
and how a squirrel comes there every day in search of food.

i showed her my insta feed, and we both laughed at it.
i taught her about the markets and why they are falling down,
i taught her about government bonds and how compounding works.
i taught her about what is debt and what is liquidity.
i taught her about ukraine, gaza, manipur, afghanistan, and samastipur.
i taught her about bombs, sirens, loots, murders, poverty and child labor.

we counted the number of dead plants in the whole world that night.
we counted each stem, each root, and each flower
who will never see the sun again.
and when we had counted them all,
on our little fingers.
ten of mine
and ten of hers,
we sat there silently watching us watching each other.

i wanted to talk more.
she did too.
i wanted to tell her about AI, github, python, and loans.
she wanted to tell me about palpitations, heart beat, 54321, and more.
but we both were tired by then
she from continuously trembling since last few hours,
i from having worked heavily all day.
so we chose not to speak.
as speaking needed too much energy.

i finally slept that night, under her gaze, peacefully, feeling safe.
and she did the same, i guess?

the next morning when i woke up
there were no lizards
and the peep hole was closed.
the walls were clean
and no one was on the floor.
i got up from my bed,
brushed my teeth and sat on my chair
and there i saw my cactus plant,
on my study,
i looked at it, smiled,
and watered it gently.
