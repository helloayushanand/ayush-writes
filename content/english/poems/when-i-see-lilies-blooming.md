when i see the lilies blooming in my garden
i see you,
taking the shape
of circle, square, rectangles
and lilies.
you grow bright and beautiful
and fill the air
with your scent all around
and i feel the air
with all of my nostrils
that i have.
i breathe that air
that pure little part of yours
which carry you within itself.
i follow you
as wind takes you to different places.
creating different waves
of emotions
and sadness
inside you
and inside me.
i relive the moment
when you touched my cheek
with you glance
and let me dive inside that ocean
of  blushes.
and small little packets of love.
i love.
i love that how you always find a way
back to your home
back to me.
back to us.
and every others.

when i see lilies blooming in my garden
i see me.
just staring down through that empty
hall.
eye to eye.
man to man.
and waiting the moment to cease
to stop the clock.
and just hold the breath
in that one moment.
one moment of failure.
and despair.
and loss.
your loss.
my loss.

when i see lilies blooming in my garden
i see us.
fondling our way through grasses
and bushes,
helping each other out
in our moment of sadness
and joy.
making french toasts
and that perfect cup of chai.
sipping through old coffee
and hugging each other.
listening to prateek kuhad
and just dozing off.
and waking in each other arms.
with sun beside our faces.

when i see lilies blooming in my garden,
i see you.

Ayush
