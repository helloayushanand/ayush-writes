It takes courage to dream about you.
As I weave my fingers into yours
Forming a great fabric
Which I wear
On cold days,
Remembering you
Remembering me.

I slide past through your dreams too
Where we play hide and seek
While sitting behind the stars
And seeking the infinite
Through each other.
You make sure that
Everytime I find you,
And everytime you lose.
So that I feel a little less lonely.

And when your dreams collide with mine
I feel shivers running through me
Through you,
And passing on the message
That we are alive
In each other.

I sit here,
Alone, on days
When you do not come to me.
I paint you in my head
With different colors that I have of you.
Stroke by stroke.
Layer by layer.
The night passes.

I wake up the next day.
Do my chores.
See your photo
And then stop for a moment.
I relive your whole presence
In front of my eyes
In that moment only.
And this is how I make me feel
Loved.
By you.

I know you love me.
I know that you are watching
Every step of mine
And guiding me through storms
Which I otherwise would never have won.
I know you are dying to come down as well.
You are just too far away to confess.

And that is all I have of you,
Dreams, photos, paintings and
Stars.

I wish I had more.

Ayush
