i like this black and white world
in front of my eyes
where other colors disappear
into surroundings and
all i am left with
is a choice.
A choice to choose
between black and white
among millions of other hues
which could have been possible
in this magical colorful world
if my eyes were not
closed.
if i were allowed to see
the vibrance of this world
the magic of its hues
and the smell of the rainbow.
but i am not.
my wings are cut
my vision is blurred
my colors are gone.
and i am told to smile.
so i smile
thanking the ones
who let me see
the world
only in black and white.
who took away my colors
and my wings to fly
who shut my mouth
to cry and shout
who put the sword through my heart
so that i can no longer
share a heart beat.
who gave me the armour to fight
those battles
i did not choose to fight.
who led me to battle field
and always stood by my side.
who gave me the choice
to choose from
black and white.

i like this black and white world
that is forced
in front of my eyes.

Ayush
